Optimal Flight Tracker
1. webscrapes (or uses google flights API) to get the flights
2. delivers a rating to each flight based on categories

ex. price, time, total transit time/lines, airlines, date

1. Price: easy, compare price to avg. price for the desired route at the current time of year
2. Time: obviously noon/afternoon/evening times are preferred, personalizable though
3. Transit Time: uses google maps to see transit costs/time to/from each airport
4. Lines: lower security wait times = better. this is universal
5. Airlines: user should select preferred airlines (high/medium/low)

User should then get returned the most optimal flights catered to their preferences.
